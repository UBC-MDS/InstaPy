#### Overview

According to a [study](http://comp.social.gatech.edu/papers/icwsm15.why.bakhshi.pdf) by Yahoo Labs, â€œFiltered photos are 21 percent more likely to be viewed and 45 percent more likely to be commented on. Have you ever wondered how you could tranform your images using filters similar to Instagram in Python? 

We present this package that performs digital image processingn using 2D convolutions. It uses a simple matrix as an image convolution kernel to do some interesting things! We have started with quite basic and diverse functionality and hope to advance and add more with time.

#### Functions

###### Gaussian blur 
This function de-emphasizes differences in adjacent pixel values. It has an averaging effect removing detail and noise resulting in blurring of the image.

>Input: image.jpg/png
>
>Output: blurred_image.jpg/png

###### Grayscale 
This function coverts a RGB image to grayscale. "amount" defines the proportion of conversion, with 100% leading to a complete grayscale and a value of 0% does not change the image at all.

>Input: image.jpg/png, amount
>
>Output: grayscale_image.jpg/png

###### Flip 
This is a tranformation function which flips the image either horizontally or vertically.

>Input: image.jpg/png, direction
>
>Output: flipped_image.jpg/png


#### Python ecosystem
"A picture paints a thousand words", however, a well constructed image speaks even more than that without having to rely on a written description. We want to explore the elements of filters and their implementation in Python. A similar module called ["ImageFilter"](http://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/5.0.0/reference/ImageFilter.html) exists in Python which has standard filters like blur, sharpen, emboss among others.  We have started with a few basic functions but want to work towards building more advanced filters similar to the ones provided by Instagram.
